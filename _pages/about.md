Hey all! I'm Aditya, a final-year honours bachelors student at the University of Toronto. I am pursuing a data science specialist, statistics specialist, as well as a computer science minor. This homepage is a little barebones at the moment (so I hope you bear with me!). But it will be updated to look a little nicer, I promise.

A brief note about the material on this website:
- My publications and talk can be found in the appropriate tabs in the menu bar.
- If you would like slides for any of my talks, please feel free to shoot me an email and I'd be glad to send them to you (if I can find it hiding in my hard drive).  
- For more extensive discussion of my background, including work experience, teaching experience and awards/grants, please see my CV.
